1. The python code to run problem1 for the histogra equalization is hist_eq.py.
2. The python code to run problem2 on dataset1 is dataset1.py.
3. The python code to run problem2 on the challenge video is challenge_video.py
4. The PDF file of the report for the project is project2_report.pdf.


hist_eq.py performs the histogram equalization on the provided video.
dataset1.py uses the video formed by stitching the images provided and performing the lane detection
challenge_video.py performs the same process on challenge_video.mp4.

The 3 video files are:
night_drive.mp4 for Problem1
lane.avi which is the video formed by stitching the images provided in dataset1
challenge_video.avi is the video for 2nd part of problem2 

The videos can be seen in the youtube links included by clicking on the links in the report.
